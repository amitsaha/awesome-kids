## Code.org

Launched in 2013, [Code.org®](https://code.org) is a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to computer science, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science. We believe computer science should be part of core curriculum, alongside other courses such as biology, chemistry or algebra.

## Hour of Code

The [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com) is a global movement reaching tens of millions of students in 180+ countries. Anyone, anywhere can organize an Hour of Code event. One-hour tutorials are available in over 40 languages. No experience needed. Ages 4 to 104.

## Games

- [Lightbot](http://lightbot.com) - Solve Puzzles using Programming Logic
- [CodeCombat](http://code.org/api/hour/begin/codecombat) - Defeat ogres to learn Python or JavaScript in this epic programming game!
- [CodeMonkey](http://code.org/api/hour/begin/codemonkey) - CodeMonkey is an online game that teaches coding in a real programming language! Students program a monkey to catch bananas while it gets slightly more complicated on each level. They get star scores on each solution and can share it in a single click.
- [Code with Anna and Elsa](http://code.org/api/hour/begin/frozen) - Let's use code to join Anna and Elsa as they explore the magic and beauty of ice. You will create snowflakes and patterns as you ice-skate and make a winter wonderland that you can then share with your friends!
